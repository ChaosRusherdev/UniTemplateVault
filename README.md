I use this vault as a template to make new vaults for my courses.

The main functionality of this template is creating quick notes and 
autosaving them to a specific folder using the dashboard.

## A hint: You may wanna customize your folders a bit first b4 diving head first in.
If you are creating a new "Main folder" for one of your main topics,
always put a number + an underscore infront of the name. Later when i explain the 
quick note / file creation im talking about a "prefix" for main folder. The 1_ or 2_ or 42_ 
is this prefix. So id recommend to use my system.

My intended folder structure looks like this:

1_NAME OF TOPIC
  1NAME OF SUBTOPIC
  **The 1 in here is just used cause obsidian will put the smallest nr first.**
  
2_NAME OF TOPIC
  2NAME OF SUBTOPIC
  4NAME OF SUBTOPIC
  
3_NAME OF TOPIC
  3NAME OF SUBTOPIC

## How to create a new note / folder:

If you take a look at Dashboard.md:

there are a few buttons

New Lecture File and
New Lecture Note 

are gonna be the most important ones. You can customize 
the other buttons and put links to your online campus in them.

New Lecture File: creates a .md file at your specified folder for you to write in.
New Lecture Note: creates a .excalidraw file at your specified folder for you to draw in.

*yeah i made this thing in kind of a hurry so everytime you create a note
using the excalidraw button itll create an empty file at / feel free to delete it til i redo the note button*

## Create New Lecture File / Note:

When u click the button. Your first prompt will be for a prefix, a prefix is a number + an underscore infront 
of the name of a "Main folder". For example 1_Calculus or 2_Linear Algebra.

After that you will get promted to give your file a name. Feel free to choose whatever name you see fit.

At last you will get a prompt for the topic. This will be a folder in the main folder with your specified prefix.
If the folder doesnt already exist, it will create it for you. I like to do something like this:

1_Main Topic
  1_Subtopic 
  **The 1_ in the Subtopic isnt a prefix, i just put this there so my folders dont get sorted by name**
  2_Subtopic
  3_Subtopic

And now you are finally done. Just open your desired file and do stuff lol. It will be in your specified sub folder of 
the main folder you specified. In the sub folder there will be another folder which has the date of the file creation as its name.
